# Binary Latent Diffusion

This repo contains the Pytorch implementation of the MICCAI submission 424 [Binary Noise for Binary Problems: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Masked Bernoulli Diffusion Models]

We currently provide:

- our code `text-to-image-demo`. 

- training instructions and models for binary autoencoders under `binary-ae`

- training instructions and models for Bernoulli diffusion under `bernoulli-diffusion`

We will upload more scripts and models later. 

This implementation is based on the following projects:

- For the comparing methods, we implement:
AutoDDPM, LDM, AnoDDPM, PatchDDPM
